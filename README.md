About Chicago Taxi Trip Analysis Project: 

Chicago Taxi Trip Database is an open source database. You can download it from the link: https://bit.ly/3ac9f9i
I used January 2018 taxi trips. 

You can see the storyline about this project in my Tableau account: https://public.tableau.com/profile/elif.karakutuk.dinc 

You can see my hypotheses and findings about the project at the below: 
Hypothesis-1: In which region the trips are mostly occured? 
Finding: The trips mostly occured at city center. Usually the trips drop off at the city center. Some trips occured at northwest. There may be important points of Chicago. 

Hypothesis-2: Is there any difference between each week? 
Finding: At third and fourth week total trip count and total revenue more than other weeks. People may be using more public transport at the beginning of the month. Towards the end of the month, they may be starting to use taxis.

Hypothesis-3: Is there any difference between week days? 
Finding: The most revenue and trip count belongs to the Wednesday. And the bottom revenue and trip count belong to the weekend. People may be just using taxis while going to work or turning to home on the weekday. 

Hypothesis-4: Is there any difference between hours of the day? 
Finding: The most busy time bucket belongs to the 13-18 time period. Our previous finding strengthened: People may be using taxis while turning to home on the weekday.

Hypothesis-5: Can regions or companies set their own price policies?
Finding: We looked at income per trip for region and companies. Income per trip is changing in every region and every company. Therefore we can say regions and companies set their own price policies. 

Hypothesis-6: Can we determine customer happiness? 
Finding: Tips show customer happiness for my opinion. If people enjoy their trips they can give more tips. I looked at the total tip revenue of companies. The most tip revenue belongs to Flash Cap. But the best tip per trip belongs to Felman Corp, Manuel Alonso. 

Hypothesis-7: Is there any difference by payment type?
Finding: Credit card payment has the most total amount than other types. But cash payment has the most count of transactions than other types. Probably people use credit cards on long trips and expensive trips. Probably people use cash on short trips.
